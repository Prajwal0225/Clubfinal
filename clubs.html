            <p class="paragraph-54"><strong>Introduction: </strong><br>Our club has experienced remarkable success in recent years, garnering recognition and accolades in various competitions and events. Despite facing challenges such as limited funding and official club authorization, our dedicated members have showcased their passion and commitment to making a difference. This article highlights our notable achievements and ongoing projects, shedding light on our journey as a club. <br><br><strong>Past Achievements:</strong> <br>First Prize in the Mobility Section of DIPEX 23: <br>1. In the esteemed DIPEX 23 event, a Maharashtra and Goa state competition organized by ABVP and SUJAN Trust, our club emerged victorious in the Event. We received the first prize for our outstanding project on &quot;Retrofitment of EV with Regenerative Braking and Smart Helmet.&quot; This achievement not only recognized our technical prowess but also demonstrated our commitment to promoting sustainable transportation solutions. <br><br>Second Prize for Paper Presentation in Energy Conclave by CMIA:<br>2. Our club also showcased its research and presentation skills in the Energy Conclave organized by CMIA. We proudly secured the second prize for our compelling paper presentation. This accomplishment underscored our club&#x27;s dedication to exploring innovative ideas and addressing the challenges faced by the energy sector. <br><br>Overcoming Challenges: <br>The path to success is seldom without obstacles, and our club faced its fair share of challenges. Despite these hurdles, our members remained resilient, determined, and united in their pursuit of excellence. <br><br>Struggles for Funding: <br>1. One of our significant challenges was securing adequate funds for our foundational projects. We encountered difficulties in sourcing financial support, but through sheer determination and resourcefulness, we managed to find alternative means and leverage partnerships to overcome this hurdle. This experience instilled in us a valuable lesson about the importance of resource management and creative problem-solving. <br><br>Official Club Authority: <br>2. While we faced setbacks in obtaining official club authorization within our college, our members did not allow this to dampen their spirits. Instead, we embraced the opportunity to operate as a dedicated group of enthusiasts, fostering a strong sense of camaraderie and motivation. We believe that true success stems from the passion and drive of individuals, regardless of official recognition. <br><br>Throughout our journey, Prof. S M Shinde Sir from our college has been an invaluable source of guidance and support. His wisdom and expertise have helped us navigate through the challenges we faced, offering valuable insights and solutions. We are grateful for his mentorship, which has played a pivotal role in our success. <br><br><strong>Current Projects and Research: </strong><br>Our club continues to explore the forefront of technology and innovation, focusing primarily on Electric Vehicle (EV) research and development. Here are some of the exciting projects currently underway: <br><br>Hydrogen Fuel Cell Research: <br>1. We are actively investigating the potential of hydrogen fuel cells as a clean and sustainable energy source for EVs. Through rigorous experimentation and collaboration with industry experts, we aim to contribute to the development of efficient and commercially viable hydrogen fuel cell technology. <br><br>Ultracapacitor Integration for EVs: <br>2. Recognizing the significance of energy storage systems in EVs, our club is engaged in research on ultracapacitors. We are exploring ways to enhance energy efficiency, improve regenerative braking capabilities, and optimize the overall performance of electric vehicles through the integration of ultracapacitor technology. <br><br>Club Membership and Recruitment: <br>Joining our club is an opportunity for students to engage in cutting-edge research, gain hands-on experience, and contribute to sustainable technological advancements. We follow a rigorous recruitment process, which includes registration and interviews, ensuring that we select passionate and committed individuals who share our vision for a greener and smarter future. <br>Our club&#x27;s journey is a testament to the power of perseverance and passion. Despite initial struggles, we have achieved significant milestones, showcasing our dedication to innovation and sustainable solutions. As we continue to advance our projects and research, we remain committed to making a positive impact on society and shaping a better future. With the ongoing support of Prof. S M Shinde Sir and the enthusiasm of our club members, we are confident in our ability to overcome future challenges and achieve even greater heights.</p>

For the same purpose Baja SAE competition is organized every year for enthusiastic engineering students. The goal in Baja SAE is to design, build and race off-road vehicles that can withstand the harshest elements of rough terrain. Team Aryans Racing is a team of auto enthusiasts and started their journey to participate in Baja SAE competition twelve years ago and the journey continues to learn with time. Team Aryans, every year, innovate, design a single seater four-wheeled off-road vehicle, and customize industrial-level components in a simplified manner that highlights the best performance of the all-terrain vehicle. Every year we participate accordingly by making past mistakes our strengths and aiming to become champions. Because we have won many competitions before, but we could not achieve AIR1 till now in BAJA SAE India competition. In recent years we have narrowly avoided becoming the BAJA SAE India champion, sometimes with luck and sometimes with time. Finally, our hard work of so many years has come to fruition. We became the winner of BAJA SAE India season 2023. In BAJA SAE INDIA 2023, we won the overall static first place, CAE rank 2, Design rank 2, Cost rank 3, and Best 4WD rank 3 honours at the national level. We are delighted that this victory has brought another honour to GECA College. Every faculty member from the college supports our team&#x27;s efforts, which always motivates us to perform better and ensures that we always act in a way that will bring honour to the institution. <br><br><strong>“If you are working on something that you really care about, you don’t have to be pushed. The vision pulls you.&quot;</strong></p>
